<h2>Welcome to the future</h2>
<p>Standard blogging has been around for nearly two decades while microblogging has been around since 2006.  Now in 2015, BroFoe is proud to present the evolution of Nanoblogging.</p>
<p>Twitter reduced character counts from indeterminate to 255.  BroFoe revolutionizes communication by cutting the noise down to a mere 3-characters per post.  You can tell people whether they're your <strong>bro</strong> or your <strong>foe</strong> with unprecedented simplicity.  Tell friends they're your <strong>sis</strong> or send them a <strong>dis</strong> with the flick of a few keystrokes.</p>
<p>By limiting posts to three characters, we have unlocked new levels of efficiency in communication. Best of all, because nasty four-letter words are not allowed, interacting on BroFoe comes with a family-friendly sense of security.  We are elevating the civility of discourse within social media one bro at a time.</p>
